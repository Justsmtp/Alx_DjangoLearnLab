Overview

This update enhances the Social Media API by adding likes and notifications functionality to improve user engagement.

Users can like/unlike posts.

Users receive notifications for important activities such as:

Someone liking their post

Gaining a new follower

Receiving comments

‚úÖ Features Implemented
1. Like Model (in posts app)

Tracks which users liked which posts.

Ensures a user can only like a post once.

Fields:

user ‚Üí ForeignKey to User

post ‚Üí ForeignKey to Post

created_at ‚Üí Timestamp of like

2. Notification Model (in notifications app)

Stores notifications for user interactions.

Fields:

recipient ‚Üí User receiving the notification

actor ‚Üí User performing the action (liking, following, commenting)

verb ‚Üí Short description of action (e.g., "liked your post")

target ‚Üí GenericForeignKey to the object (e.g., Post, Comment)

timestamp ‚Üí When it happened

is_read ‚Üí Boolean for read/unread status

üîó API Endpoints
üìç Likes
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/posts/<int:pk>/like/	Like a post
POST	/posts/<int:pk>/unlike/	Unlike a post

Example request (authenticated user):

POST /posts/5/like/
Authorization: Bearer <token>


Example response:

{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Post liked successfully."
}

üìç Notifications
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/notifications/	Retrieve all notifications for the logged-in user
GET	/notifications/?unread=true	Retrieve unread notifications only

Example response:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "actor": "john_doe",
    "verb": "liked your post",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-18T10:45:32Z",
    "is_read": false
  }
]

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Liking a Post

Creates an entry in the Like model.

Generates a notification for the post‚Äôs owner.

Unliking a Post

Deletes the entry from the Like model.

No new notification is created.

Notifications System

Triggered when:

A post is liked.

A user is followed.

A comment is made.

Notifications are retrievable via /notifications/.

Users can filter unread notifications.

üß™ Testing

Liking/unliking posts was tested via Postman and Django tests.

Notifications were verified for:

Likes

Follows

Comments

Confirmed ordering by newest first.
